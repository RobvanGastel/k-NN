# k-NN
The k-nearest neighbor algorithm implemented in Python. To test our model for different distance metrics the MNIST dataset is used. The `run` and `main` files are meant to run the model on either the small dataset included in the repository or the large dataset. The results of these runs are stored in the `results` directory.

The notebooks contain the evaluation of the model and our choice of pre-processing and PCA. In plots notebook the different distance metrics and their results are plotted as well as the performance on processed data. The choice of Max-pooling and PCA is also implemented in the notebooks.
